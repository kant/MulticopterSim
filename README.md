# About

MulticopterSim is a simple multicopter flight simulator using Unreal Engine 4.  It runs on Windows and Linux.

I began this project using the [V-REP platform](https://github.com/simondlevy/Hackflight-VREP) but switched to
UnrealEngine after seeing the kinds of beautiful, real-time simulations that
Microsoft was able to get with its
[AirSim](https://github.com/Microsoft/AirSim) program. 

MulticopterSim differs from AirSim in a few important ways:
* MulticopterSim can be used with the same simple flight-control 
[firmware](https://github.com/simondlevy/Hackflight/tree/master/src) that we fly on our real-world 
[quadcopters](http://diydrones.com/profiles/blogs/flight-of-the-ladybug).
* MulticopterSim is tiny, under 2,000 lines of code.
* MulticopterSim focuses exclusively on multirotor firmware, whereas AirSim
  supports deep learning and different kinds of vehicles.

# Prerequisites

## Hardware

I am currently developing MulticopterSim on an HP Z440 workstation with 32GB
RAM and NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1080 Ti. It may however be possible to develop on a
less &ldquo;loaded&rdquo; machine &ndash; see
[here](https://docs.unrealengine.com/latest/INT/GettingStarted/RecommendedSpecifications/)
for the minimum requirements recommended by Unreal Engine.

For a realistic flying experience, you will also likely want some sort of game
controller or R/C transmitter.  MulticopterSim currently supports the following controllers
through the [Joystick](https://github.com/simondlevy/MulticopterSim/blob/master/Source/MainModule/joystick/Joystick.h) class:

* PS4 controller
* XBox 360 controller
* XBox 360 controller clone
* PS3 controller clone
* Logitech Extreme Pro 3D joystick
* Logitech F310 gamepad
* FrSky Taranis TX9 RC transmitter with mini USB cable 
* Spektrum transmitter with WS1000 wireless simulator dongle
* Great Planes RealFlight Interlink

## Toolchain

You will need Unreal Engine 4 (UE4). I am attempting to use the latest version, which as of the time of this
writing is UE4.24. To install UE4, follow these [instructions](https://docs.unrealengine.com/en-US/GettingStarted/Installation/index.html).

# Build

Although MulticopterSim is designed to work with any flight-control software
you like, it easiest to get started with the
[Hackflight](https://github.com/simondlevy/Hackflight) software. So to get started, you should 
do the following:

1. Clone the master branch of this repository (MulticopterSim) into your
<b>Documents/Unreal Projects</b> folder, first creating that folder if it
doesn't exist.
   
2. Clone the  [HackflightModule](https://github.com/simondlevy/MulticopterSim/tree/HackflightModule) branch
of the repository onto your desktop, rename it <b>FlightModule</b>, and drag the
<b>FlightModule</b> folder into the <b>MulticopterSim/Source</b> folder.

3. Clone the [Hackflight](https://github.com/simondlevy/Hackflight) repository into your 
<b>DocumentsArduino/libraries</b> folder, first creating that folder if it
doesn't already exist.  (You don't need to install Arduino; this is simply
where MulticopterSim 
[looks for](https://github.com/simondlevy/MulticopterSim/blob/HackflightModule/Source/FlightModule/FlightModule.Build.cs#L23)
the Hackflight software.)

4. Follow the next steps to complete the build on your OS.

## Windows

1. Right-click on the <b>MulticopterSim.uproject</b> 
file and select <b>Generate Visual Studio project file</b> to generate a <b>.sln</b> file

2. Double-click on the resulting <b>MulticopterSim.sln</b> file to launch VisualStudio.  The first time
you do this, you may have to wait a few minutes while Visual Studio parses up all of the UE4 files needed
to build the project.

3. In VisualStudio, hit the `F5` key to build the project and launch UnrealEditor.

## Linux

```
% cd ~/Documents/Unreal\ Projects/MulticopterSim/
% ./build.sh
% ./run.sh
```

# Launch and fly!

In UnrealEditor, select one of the maps in <b>Content/Flying/Maps</b>. Then in
<b>Content/C++ Classes</b>, open the <b>FlightModule</b> folder and drag the
vehicle pawn into the map. Click the play button and you're ready to begin.
You can use the 1,2,3 keys to switch your point-of-view.

# Design principles

The core of MulticopterSim is the abstract C++ 
[FlightManager](https://github.com/simondlevy/MulticopterSim/blob/master/Source/MainModule/FlightManager.hpp) 
class. This class provides support for running the vehicle dynamics and the PID control
regime (e.g., Hackflight) on its own thread, after it first disables the
built-in physics in UE4.  The dynamics we used are based directly on the model
presented in this [paper](https://infoscience.epfl.ch/record/97532/files/325.pdf), 
written as a standalone, header-only C++ 
[class](https://github.com/simondlevy/MulticopterSim/blob/master/Source/MainModule/dynamics/MultirotorDynamics.hpp)
that can be easily adapted for other simulators and applications if desired.
This class also supports different frame configurations (quadcopter,
hexacopter) via virtual methods. By running the FlightManager on its own
thread, we are able to achieve arbitrarily fast updates of the dynamics and
flight-control.  It would also be possible to run the dynamics and control on
separate threads, though we have not yet found it advantageous to do that.

The FlightManager API contains a single virtual 
[getMotors](https://github.com/simondlevy/MulticopterSim/blob/master/Source/MainModule/FlightManager.hpp#L41-L51)
method that accepts the current time and the state of the vehicle (as computed by the
dynamics), and returns the current motor values.  The motor values are then
passed to the dynamics object, which computes the new vehicle state.  On the
main thread, UE4's <b>Tick()</b> method queries the flight manager for the
current vehicle pose (location, rotation) and displays the vehicle and its
environment kinematically at the 60-120Hz frame rate of the game engine.  In a
similar manner, the 
[Camera](https://github.com/simondlevy/MulticopterSim/blob/master/Source/MainModule/Camera.hpp)
class can be used to process
the images collected by a simulated gimbal-mounted camera on the vehicle, using
a library like OpenCV (see [below](#opencv)).  Computer-vision algorithms running in a Camera subclass can then be used
as input to the PID control running in the FlightManager.  The following figure
illustrates this arrangement, using a traditional
[cascade-control](https://controlguru.com/the-cascade-control-architecture/)
(slow outer loop / fast inner loop) diagram:

In addition, an abstract, threaded C++
[TargetManager](https://github.com/simondlevy/MulticopterSim/blob/master/Source/MainModule/TargetManager.hpp)
class supports modeling interaction with other moving objects having their own dynamics; for example,
in a predator/prey scenario. 

# Support for other programming languages / packages

## Matlab

[This folder](https://github.com/simondlevy/MulticopterSim/tree/master/Extras/matlab) contains an example of how
you can control MulticopterSim from a Matlab session running on your computer or another computer.

## Python

[This folder](https://github.com/simondlevy/MulticopterSim/tree/master/Extras/python) contains an example of how

## OpenCV

To enable projects using machine vision, MulticopterSim includes support for the popular OpenCV package.
